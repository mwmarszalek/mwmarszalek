## Projects

- [MacrOS - Calorie Calculator & Tracking App - Front-end](https://github.com/larrywongkahei/MacrOS) | [Back-end](https://github.com/mwmarszalek/MacrOS_backend): MacrOS is a full-stack calorie tracking application, with functionality allowing users set nutrition goals, track and view their daily food/calorie/macro intake and monitor their progress over time. It was developed as a team project over 14 days using Javascript, React and Bootstrap, with a Java Spring Boot server and a PostgreSQL database. I took a lead on programming the onboarding and registration process. Since development it has been beta tested by a number of fitness enthusiasts including a former professional rugby player who say that the user experience and quality of tracking put it leagues ahead of its main competitor myfitnesspal.

- [BeeCareful](https://github.com/mwmarszalek/BeeCareful): Beecareful is a full-stack app for beehive management. It allows users to track daily inspections, hive health, bee colonies and weather (using external API). It was developed as a team project over 7 days using React and javascript with an Express server and a MongoDB database. We developed the app using feedback from an experienced apiarist looking to improve on current applications available on the market and was tested with his colonies after development. I took the lead on designing the React front-end (components hierarchy and relationships and UX). It received very positive feedback from users who praised the user interface.

- [EarthTrekker](https://github.com/mwmarszalek/EarthTrekker): Users can browse available pets and submit adoption requests with full admin functionality for the charity management. Group project built in 5 days using React JS, Express.js and MongoDB
