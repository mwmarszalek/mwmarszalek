<a href="https://github.com/mwmarszalek/MacrOS_frontend">MacrOS® - Calorie Calculator & Tracking App - Front-end</a> | <a href="https://github.com/mwmarszalek/MacrOS_backend">Back-end</a>: &nbsp; MacrOS is a full-stack calorie tracking application, with functionality allowing users set nutrition goals, track and view their daily food/calorie/macro intake and monitor their progress over time. It was developed as a team project over 14 days using Javascript, React and Bootstrap, with a Java Spring Boot server and a PostgreSQL database. I took a lead on programming the onboarding and registration process. Since development it has been beta tested by a number of fitness enthusiasts including a former professional rugby player who say that the user experience and quality of tracking put it leagues ahead of its main competitor myfitnesspal.

[BeeCareful®](https://github.com/mwmarszalek/BeeCareful): &nbsp; Beecareful is a full-stack app for beehive management. It allows users to track daily inspections, hive health, bee colonies and weather (using external API). It was developed as a team project over 7 days using React and javascript with an Express server and a MongoDB database. We developed the app using feedback from an experienced apiarist looking to improve on current applications available on the market and was tested with his colonies after development. I took the lead on designing the React front-end (components hierarchy and relationships and UX). It received very positive feedback from users who praised the user interface.</p>

[EarthTrekker®](https://github.com/mwmarszalek/EarthTrekker): &nbsp; Earth Trekker is my first full-stack CRUD app developed solo over 5 days in Python with Flask and a PostgreSQL database which allows users to track countries and cities they visited or plan to visit. I drew from my own experience as a seasoned traveller to design the functionality and user interface.
